| Dec 3  |   6-8pm    | I have no idea how to approach this problem set. My original approach was that each character (a-z, punctuation) is represented by 8 bits. Because I only need around 32 different combinations (26 letters, assume 6ish random characters), I can make each character be represented by a 5-bit run. However this still doesn't get me to 50%.<br/>My next idea was to use a hash system: basically, let's say each word on average is 5 letters long. Then, we know that each word is represented by 5*8=40 bits.<br/>On the other hand, the English language has around 600k different words. If we can just represent each word as a unique hash (2^19 = 600kish; 19-bit representation of a word would give us 50 %) and store words instead of letters, we can probably get to 50%. Hopefully.<br/>Update: completed a "draft" of my code which definitely does not work. While working on the expansion operation I realized, even if I can get a hash (without collisions), I don't know how long my word is. I give up it's been 2 hours. |

I'm using the LZW algorithm to compress, which consists of codes of different characters being stored in a TST and used to compact repeated strings into a much smaller space.  This algorithm works because, given a text file with just the codes, we can piece together the original file even without metadata telling us what the codes are. |

My expand function was written in a similar way to my compress function where I look ahead to a code in front of the one I'm actually processing in order to gain more information about it. In order to more efficiently read my .bin files, I've come up with a python program that takes my dumpbinary data and converts it to hex/characters. |

Originally, for my compress function I was going to just write out the code that I created on that "turn" (ex if I added the code AB to my tst I also outputted it to my .bin file). This was not the right approach because I would print out codes that had just been created instead of only printing that code when I found other repeats of it. I solved this problem by implementing a lastworking variable, which stored the longest string that I already had a code for. This solved my problems in compress. In expand, my main problem was that I wasn't incrementing codenum, the variable I use to store which code I'm currently at. With those revisions, my abra.txt worked. |

My main bug was that when I initialized my TST in compress, I only initialized A-Z and not the first 128 ascii characters. Oops. I also added bounds on where I use codenum in my code because I only want the codes to reach the maximum code for an 8-bit value right now; if I didn't have the bounds on codenum I would try to output more combinations than I have space for in my 8 bits, or I would go out of range in my map when expanding. My code now works for all the test cases, but doesn't quite yet reach the required compression ratios. I'm currently at 60% for alice instead of the required 43%. |

I just tried 12 bit codes for Alice, which got me down to 43.2%. I'm not sure what the required ratio for Shakespeare is, but I'm currently sitting at 46.6%, a little higher than Alice. I think if I use 16-bit codes for Shakespeare it will make it even better because it's a longer text file. I am right, as I got it down to 38.9% with 16 bits. |

I first figured out what the optimal bit lengths were for each code were for alice and shakespeare using a shell script. I also rewrote my compress() code using the getLongestPrefix function, which now checks for the longest prefix in O(N) time instead of O(N^2) which my original algorithm did. My original algorithm was O(N^2) because every time I read in a char from STDin, I re-checked the new prefix, which goes over every character again. I fixed this by reading in the whole thing as a string first, and just indexing through the big string. It now works. |
